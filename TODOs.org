* Automation Scritps TODOs
** DONE create template for new python files
the template should have a main script, unit and integration test modules in a folder
** DONE create scafold of python files
** directory operations
(use outside)

using the common logic as the call script on every directory
most of those scripts will become a multiple files operations
*** common logic
**** TODO get the current directory
**** TODO get all items inside the current directory
not recursively
**** TODO filter only folders
**** TODO for each folder
***** TODO excecute script on folder
***** TODO make script excecution run in parallel
maybe have an argument be pased to the script to choose between sequential and parallel escecution
*** TODO script to remove undesirable files from a directory
**** algorithm
***** common logic from parent
****** TODO get every item in the directory recursivelly
****** TODO if the item is in the undesirable files list
the undesirable files list is as follows:

- subtitle files (.srt/.vtt)
- .url files in the folder (not recursive)
- .py files from automation scripts
****** TODO delete the file
*** TODO script to separate downloaded torrent "types"
separate in sub-folders if the contents of a folder is:
- mp3 -> audiobook
- mp4 -> videos
- pdf -> books
- exe -> games
**** algorithm
***** common logic from parent
excecute script on each folder
****** TODO get current directory
****** TODO get all items inside the directory recursivelly
****** TODO mark which types of files are more predominant in the directory
****** TODO based on type of directory move it to a sub-folder in the parent directory
*** TODO script to remove all python scripts from each emediate nested folders
**** algorithm
***** common logic from parent
excecute script on each folder
****** TODO get all items in the directory
****** TODO filter only files
****** TODO filter only .py files
****** TODO delete every .py file
*** TODO script to call command on emediate nested folders
this script actually can be the common logic used by all the other scripts in the category
**** algorithm
***** common logic from parent
excecute script on each folder
****** TODO call the command passed to the script
*** TODO script to copy all python scripts from current directory into nested folders
ideally this script will not be needed
*** TODO script to mark a folder as of having a concatenated video inside
a folder with a concatenated video has a video with the same name of the folder

there should be better ways of checking if the convertion and concatenation is finished
like checking the number of videos in the converted directory against the videos directory

there is also the problem of a concatenated video being invalid because some converted video is corrupted
*** TODO script to check if the converted videos are all working
**** algorithm
***** TODO get all videos in the converted folder
***** TODO try to get the length of the video
***** TODO if the length is 0.0 the video is corrupted
*** TODO script to remove videos from every emediate nested directory
**** algotithm
***** common logic
for every folder
****** get every video in the emediate directory
****** get all videos in the videos/ and converted/ folders
****** delete al the videos
*** TODO script to separate folders of videos into [long] or [short]
**** algorithm
***** common logic
for every folder
****** get data from the videos data file created by another script
it is a .csv file
****** check the total duration of videos
****** if the duration is greater than 12 hours
******* the folder is long
****** else
******* the folder is short
****** move the folder to the appropriate directory
*** STRT script to sort folders by their "youtube upload viability" without concatenating
**** algorithm
***** common logic
for each folder
****** create a viability score variable
this variable goes from 0 to 10 depending on the viability of the folder
being uploaded to youtube without being processed first

a score of 0 means it must be processed first

a score of 10 means it must be uploaded as is without being processed

a score in between needs to be tested to gauge the actual viability
****** get all the videos in the directory
****** count the number of videos
****** if the count is 15 or less
******* the viability score is 10
****** if the count is bigger than 100
******* the viability score is 0
****** if the count is in from 16 to 99
******* get the size all viideos
******* get the avarage size of a video
******* interpolate the viability
based on the number of videos and the avarage size of a video

the smaller the number of videos
and the bigger the avarage size of a video
the higher the score

******** algorithm

...

******* and truncate to intiger
****** move the folder based on the viability
create folders for integers from 0 to 10
**** DONE a folder that has 15 videos or less is totally viable
**** DONE a fodler that does not have videos is not viable
**** TODO a folder that has the biggest videos and the smallest amount of videos is viable
** single file operations
those scripts should be turned into a library
*** TODO script to change the extension of a given file
*** STRT script to check if a file is a video
*** STRT script to check if a video file is corrupted
*** TODO script to search and replace filenames in a directory
the script receives the parameters:

-s/--search : the string to be searched on every file in the directory
-r/--replace : the string to replace the searched string
-R/--recursive : if the search should be done recursivelly (include sub-directories)
-f/--files : flag to restrict search to only files
-d/--dirs : flag to restrict search to only directories

*** TODO script to get the duration of a video
*** TODO script to get the dimensions of a video
*** TODO script to get the size of a file
** multiple files operations

**** algorithm
*** TODO script to compress the files/ directory into a .7z file
**** algorithm
***** get the working directory
***** get all items in working directory
***** filter only directories
***** filter files/ directory
***** call zip command with files/ directory as parameter
*** TODO script to add to the start of the name of every file
**** parameters
-f/--files : flag to process only files
-d/--dirs : flag to process only directories

**** algorithm
***** check parameters
***** get the current working directory
***** get all items in the directory
***** filter files or direcories based on parameters
if no parameter is given don't filter
***** get the source path of every item
current working directory + item

** folder hierarcy:
*** vid_auto_process
**** 00_strait_out_of_torrents/

the first folder where the completed downloads are moved (manually)

**** 01_separate_torrent_types/

run *separate_torrents* here

*separate_torrents* should move the folders from *00_strait_out_of_torrents* to *02_separate_videos_subs_files* based on the type of file that is more prominent in the folder

if there are files in this folder, create a folter with the same name of the file and move it in there before moving the created folder to *02_separate_videos_subs_files*

**** 02_separated_torrent_types/

this directory has the category folders:

0_videos/
0_books/
0_audios/
0_software/
0_compressed/
0_others/

move folders in videos/ to V_Videos/02_separate_videos_subs_files
**** V_Videos/
***** 03_separate_videos_subs_files/

folder containing only other folders
each folder contains videos in subfolders or on the root folder

run *separate_videos_subs_files* here

*separate_videos_subs_files* should create 3 folders:

videos/
subs/
files/

*separate_videos_subs_files* should move the appropriate files to each folder.

move all folders to 04_get_video_info
***** 04_get_video_info_csv/

this folder contains other folders with videos in their root

run *get_video_info_csv* here

*get_video_info_csv* should create a .csv file with the following columns:

| filename | duration_in_seconds | duration_in_hours | accumulated_duration_in_seconds | accumulated_duration_in_hours | width | height | aspect_ratio | size | accumulated_size | codec info |

use a combination of ffmpeg, ffmprobe, mediainfo and opencv

also use multiprocessing

***** 05_check_for_subtitles/

*check_for_subtitles* checks the subs/ and the videos/ folder to check if each video has subtitle

move the root folder to *06_embed_subtitles/* folder if has sub

move the root folder to *07_separate_to_upload* if hasnt sub
